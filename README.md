📌 Project: **Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy for Telecom Industry**

---
This project focuses on identifying customers who are likely to **leave (churn)** a telecom service and proposes **strategies to retain** them. Using **machine learning algorithms**, we built a predictive model that classifies customer churn based on historical data. The project is designed to help telecom companies take **proactive measures** to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

Key components of the project:

✅ **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**

✅ **Model Building & Evaluation** using algorithms like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**

✅ **Confusion Matrix Analysis** for performance insights

✅ Deployment using **Flask** and **FastAPI**

✅ **Interactive Dashboard** created using **Power BI** for visualization and business insights

The model is trained to understand customer behavior and identify **churn risk factors** such as **contract type**, **monthly charges**, and **tenure**. These insights can drive **data-driven decisions** to reduce customer attrition.
